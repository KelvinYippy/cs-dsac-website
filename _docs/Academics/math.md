CS Majors have one required math course to take during their degree path: a section of discrete mathematics. This course can be taken via the computer science OR the math department.


### CPSC 202
"Mile Wide, Inches Deep"

- Taught by CS professors
- Focuses more on application of discrete mathematics than theory
- Topics include logic, set theory, methods of proof, number theory, graph theory, probability, combinatorics, and linear algebra.
- Usually only one section per term offered (large lecture format)
- Meets twice per week
