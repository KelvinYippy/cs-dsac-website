In CS classes, much of the learning happens outside of official lecture
time --- during office hours! The vast majority of CS classes have
office hours led by professors, TFs (grad students), or ULAs (undergrad
students who've taken the class before). At most office hours, you'll
either review important concepts before exams or get one-on-one help on
your problem sets! It can be a great opportunity to meet fellow
classmates and get help debugging your code, so it's highly recommended
that you attend!

You can find your class's office hours schedule either on the official
class webpage, Canvas page, and/or
[[https://csofficehours.org/]](https://csofficehours.org/). Go as
early as possible --- as it gets closer to a problem set deadline or
exam date, office hours get more and more packed, and it can be harder
to get help. Office hours can be an incredible way to rehash lecture
concepts, solve problem sets, get to know upperclassmen, and meet new
people all in the span of an hour or two!
