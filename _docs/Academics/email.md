### Mailing Lists
New to Yale CS? The first thing you should do is join the [cs-majors
mailing list](http://mailman.cs.yale.edu/mailman/listinfo/cs-majors)!
Anyone can join the list, even if they haven't declared the major. This
is the best place to find opportunities, speaker events, applications,
and of course, DSAC info! If you ever need to advertise an event, you
can also feel free to directly email the list as well
(cs-majors\[at\]cs.yale.edu).

The [cs-majors-jobs mailing
list](http://mailman.cs.yale.edu/mailman/listinfo/cs-majors-jobs) is
another great resource to get internships, interviews, and other job
opportunities. Again, anyone can join the list!
