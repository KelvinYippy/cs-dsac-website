### Hackathons

Hackathons are a fantastic way to learn or improve on new technology
skills. Yale\'s biggest hackathon is [YHack](https://www.yhack.org/),
usually held in the beginning of December every year. There are
routinely more than 1000 attendees every year from schools all over the
world, and any Yale student is guaranteed admission. In 2017, YHack
featured over \$57,200 in prizes. There are also a variety of other,
smaller hackathons that clubs and organizations hold throughout the
year, which students also hear of via mailing list.
