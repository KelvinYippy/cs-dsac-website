## Personal Websites

The Zoo no longer supports publishing your own website. Please look at the following ITS supported options for this use case:

- [CampusPress WordPress for Individuals and Groups](http://campuspress.yale.edu/)
- [YaleSites for Registered Student Orgs and Labs](https://yalesites.yale.edu/)
- Look into GitHub Developer Student hosting options at [GitHub](https://education.github.com)
