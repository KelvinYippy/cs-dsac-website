# Resources for CS Students

> [EDIT](https://yaledsac.fandom.com/wiki/Resources_for_CS_Students?veaction=edit)

There is no doubt that the long slough to that fancy piece of paper at
the end of your four years can be difficult, but the journey can be made
much easier by taking advantage of some of institutional resources that
Yale offers. There are a variety of university-supported and
student-organized resources to help CS students with homework,
networking, hacking, and more.
