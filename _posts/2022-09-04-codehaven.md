Hi everyone!
 
We're so excited to announce that Code Haven mentor applications are now open! Code Haven is a student-run organization at Yale dedicated to making computer science more inclusive. Each week, our mentors teach block-based programming to New Haven middle schoolers and introduce them to the world of computer science.
 
If you're passionate about making CS accessible to all, inspiring the next generation of coders, and working with the New Haven community, we'd love for you to join us! No programming experience necessary. The [application](https://forms.gle/G3b11t7mhKGdUxK9A) process is simple -- you'll fill out this quick [application](https://forms.gle/G3b11t7mhKGdUxK9A) (which should take fewer than 20 minutes!) and [schedule an interview](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X289Gikf8LknJOiSFcaW-N_YsgoQDa7FoSdmVs3QKXE/edit#gid=0) with our board members. All Yale undergraduates are welcome to apply!
 
The application is due on Saturday, September 10, at 11:59 PM EST. Interviews will be conducted remotely and in-person the following week.
 
If you want to learn more about the club or just meet some awesome individuals in Code Haven who do a range of different things at Yale, we are hosting some lunches over the next two weeks. These are meant to be relaxed opportunities to talk about Code Haven or whatever else is on your mind. [You can see when and where they are on this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ismg6w3Km_G_NKBX00OMgTzbzbaYVEy61oVjokkVXII/edit#gid=0). Coming (or not) to lunch will have no impact on your application. It is just an opportunity to get to know us.

Best,
Code Haven Board
