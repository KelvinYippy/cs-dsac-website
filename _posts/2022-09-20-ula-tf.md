Hi, all,

We just received more TF/ULA resources from the Grad School because we are still in considerable need to TF and ULA help for the semester.  Here is the list of courses still in need of help:

CS 150:  CompSci&ModrnIntellctualAgenda 
CS 183:  Law, Technology, & Culture
CS 419:  Full Stack Web Programming CPSC 419/CPSC 519
CS 424:  ParallelProgrammingTechniques CPSC 424/CPSC 524
CS 446:  Data and Info. Visualization CPSC 446/CPSC 546
CS 464:  Algorithms and Society CPSC 464/CPSC 564
CS 465:  Theory of Distributed Systems CPSC 465/CPSC 565
CS 472:  Intelligent Robotics CPSC 472/CPSC 572
CS 474:  Comp Intelligence for Games CPSC 474/CPSC 574
CS 475:  ComputatlVision&BiologPerceptn
CS 668:  Blockchain Research

The courses in red are in great need of more help.  So, if you are able (and wouldn't mind picking up some extra cash), please get back to us with what assignment(s) you are interested in, and we will connect you with the instructor to make sure you are a fit.

Thanks in advance for your help!
Alex, Will and Ruzica
