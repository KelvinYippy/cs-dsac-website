**Find Computer Science & associated joint majors in the lower level of Commons at The Well! 1:00p - 2:30p**

The Academic Fair brings together representatives from Yale’s 80+ majors and programs to provide information and answer student questions about course placement, course sequences, first-year course offerings, majors, and more. All first-year students, including new transfer and Eli Whitney students, are encouraged to attend.

This year’s Academic Fair will take place in-person.

Students can expect to meet the director of undergraduate studies (DUS) and, often, other faculty members, language program directors (in language departments), senior majors, or members of each departments’ Student Advisory Committee.

Also participating in the Academic Fair will be representatives from campus academic resource offices, such as the Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning, the library system, the health professions office, the Office of Career Strategy, the Center for Language Study, the Fellowships Office, and the Science & QR Education Office.
