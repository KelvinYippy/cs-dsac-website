Hey CS Majors!


DSAC would like to welcome you (back) to Yale CS with free food and swag raffles on Thursday, Sep 8 @ 8p - 9p in the Zoo (AKW, 2nd Floor Atrium)! Free donuts, food, and an opportunity to meet new and returning friends in the department.

 

First years - weâ€™re so excited to welcome you to the department! Please stop by at 7:30p for a short introduction and overview to your next four years at Yale CS. (And stay for the food afterwards!)
