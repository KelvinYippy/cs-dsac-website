ðŸ”Š FOUNDERS and BUILDERS ðŸ”Š

Are you a student-founder looking to build your own venture? Join [Reactor â€˜23!](https://www.floodgate.com/reactor)

This 8-month program, run by Floodgate, is designed to ignite the founders of the future.

Reactor teaches exceptional undergrad founders to identify inflections, develop insights, and ultimately build amazing businesses - all while learning intimately from the cohort, successful founders and domain experts.

This small and highly selective cohort begins remotely in January and becomes in-person in June when all Reactors come together to build their startups in the Floodgate offices in the Bay Area. 

[Applications](https://airtable.com/shr7TghmC75inZFLP) for Reactor are OPEN and DUE Friday, October 21st at 11:59pm PT!
