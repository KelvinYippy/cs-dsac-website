If you are currently interning or working a tech job, consider volunteering to give referrals to your fellow students! This year, DSAC is looking to improve CS students' career advising, particularly by making the internship/job search more accessible for students. We especially want to help students who are new to the major or from an underrepresented background make connections with other Yalies. One of our initiatives is this referral matching process, in which current interns/employees can give referrals to fellow Yalies and help boost their internship/job applications. 

Our goal is to make the referral matching process as quick and easy as possible for our referral writers. If you volunteer to give a referral, all you have to do is complete [this quick form about yourself](https://forms.gle/MqrRynMkhWrp5J8d8). You can specify the number of referrals you'd like to give, and at the end of July/beginning of August, we'll then send you all the information you'll need to complete your referrals. You can write your referrals at any time before your individual company's deadline (we understand that some referral forms aren't open yet), and you won't have to do any extra work (e.g. meeting with the students, writing your own recommendation) on your part if you would prefer not to. We will also keep all of your personal information confidential, and everything will be handled internally. The deadline to complete this form is Friday, July 15th. 

If you have concerns about referring students you don't personally know, note that:
You are not obligated to give referrals to every single student whose info we send to you! We understand that at some companies, referrals are a direct reflection of you, so you can choose to give referrals at your own discretion. We will send you the student's resume, which you can review, and you can also feel free to reach out to the student if you have questions as well. Students won't know that we sent you their info, and they therefore also won't know if you chose not to write a referral for them. 
For most companies, you can indicate the degree to which you know the student. There's usually an option that states that you don't personally know the student or are just a classmate of that student if you'd like to make that distinction. 

Also, if you are interested in receiving a referral, we will send out another form later this month!

[TLDR; fill out this form by Friday, July 15th!](https://forms.gle/MqrRynMkhWrp5J8d8)

Please reach out to us if you have any questions! You can email dsac@cs.yale.edu or reply to this email!

Best,
DSAC 2022-2023
