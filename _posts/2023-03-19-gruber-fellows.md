Rebecca and I are Yale Gruber Fellows organizing the Peer Pathways Nights, bisemesterly info-sessions for undergraduates providing advice on themes relating to graduate school in STEM. 

Our next Peer Pathways Night event on 3/29 features four student speakers providing advice on securing research opportunities with the goal of applying to graduate school in STEM.

 We would be grateful for your help spreading this opportunity to the undergraduates in your STEM department. Pub announcement and [sign up link](https://forms.gle/YzJxQT6nr2kjrASx9) pasted below, and poster is attached.
