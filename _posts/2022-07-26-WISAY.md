You may or may not know that Women and Gender Minorities in Science at Yale is run by a small group of dedicated students and post-docs who operate as a collaborative board. We are currently seeking undergrad, grad student, and post-doc board members.
 
The WISAY executive board meets monthly to plan all WISAY events and programs (panels, speakers, mentoring, career development, etc.). A position on our board is not only fun and rewarding, but also an excellent opportunity to gain event planning, outreach, and networking skills!

To apply for a WISAY board position you should be:

- At least a rising sophomore undergrad student, rising second-year grad student, or early post-doc
- Able to commit to a position for at least 1 year (but preferably more)
- Interested in issues pertaining to women and gender minorities in science
- A highly motivated person able to take initiative
- Responsible, committed, and excellent at responding to emails in a timely manner
- Personable and a team player (We promise you, we have a lot of fun!)
- If accepted, committing to attending monthly 2-hour board meetings and being involved in planning at least 1 event per semester

Think you might be the enthusiastic and motivated new board member we're looking for?
