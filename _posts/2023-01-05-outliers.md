Are you an exceptional builder who wants to shape the future of crypto??? 


Join [Outliers 2023](http://outliers.build/) to learn from legendary crypto founders, amazing peers, and top venture capitalists.


This community is run by the Outliers with the support of [Floodgate](http://floodgate.com/) and [Standard Crypto](https://standardcrypto.vc/portfolio/). We empower young builders to gain integral knowledge, skills, and community in crypto. No prior crypto experience required!


There are two key components to being an Outlier: our 10-week summer program and our community-driven initiatives. The summer program facilitates intimate conversations with top crypto founders, such as the founders of Solana & Starkware, while covering key concepts in entrepreneurship.The community-driven initiatives give you the opportunity to work alongside the best builders in crypto to create projects like Leela and the Outliers NFT. 


Weâ€™re onboarding our next small, highly selective cohort of Outliers this winter. Our past Outliers have gone on to found their own startups and work for companies like Circle and Starkware. 


Applications for Outliers are OPEN and DUE Friday, January 27th at 11:59pm PT!
